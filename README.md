strategy
========

Using BDD and DDD to build a small battle engine with two modes: Simple and Advanced.

The simple uses dice Rolls only . The advanced uses stats and dice rolls

There are three weapons each with their own unique attack methods.

Sword is used once per round and uses the Players Strength level.
Spear is used three times per round  and depends on PLayers Skill level.
Wand can be used twice per round and depends on players Magic Level.

The Strategy pattern is used to allow for:

Advanced: Sword
Advanced: Spear
Advanced: Wand
Simple: Sword
Simple: Spear
Simple: Wand
